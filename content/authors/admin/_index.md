<p align="justify">Jóhanna Kristín Birnir is Professor in the Department of Government and Politics and the Director of GVPT Global Learning. She studies the effect of identity on contentious political outcomes and has done extensive fieldwork in the Andes, Southeast Europe and Indonesia.  Jóhanna´s  first book <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ethnicity-and-electoral-politics/7ED34C5132DF68D4B34012256EA1BC7F"><i>Ethnicity and Electoral Politics</i></a> (Cambridge University Press, 2009) examines the relationship between political access and minority strategic choice of peaceful electoral participation, protest, or violence against the state.  Her current book project (under contract with Cambridge University Press and supported by the Global Religion Research Initiative - University of Notre Dame) examines the relationship between identity (ethnicity and religion) and minority peaceful and violent political mobilization.  Jóhanna´s articles on identity and politics are published in numerous academic journals including the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Comparative Political Studies</i>, the <i>Journal of Peace Research</i>, the <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>, <i>Party Politics</i>, the <i>Latin American Research Review</i>, and the <i>Journal of Global Security Studies</i>.  Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, and the Folke Bernadotte Academy.</p>
